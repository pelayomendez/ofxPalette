# ofxPalette

Simple addon mainly created to use and test palettes with Openframeworks from 
colourlovers.com website, but it should work with other popular palette generators 
or you can build your own palette files.

This is addon is inspired by Alba CorralÂ´s Janebeta7 Processing color library 
(https://github.com/janebeta7/janebeta7Libs)
